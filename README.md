# Workshop Management System (Ministry of Education - Sri Lanka)

A standalone parallel web application built with **Next.js 14**, **TypeScript**, and **Vanilla CSS Design System**, designed for workshop planning, participant management, and organizational hierarchy lifecycle approvals across all educational administrative tiers.

> **Future Integration Note**: Designed with clean domain separation so it can be seamlessly embedded into the **Budget Management System as the Workshop Management module** without redesigning the core workflow or schemas.

## 🏛️ Organizational Hierarchy (4 Levels)

The system enforces strict hierarchy-based access control and target organization permission filtering:

| Level | Organization Type | Description | System Unit Rule |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Level 1** | **MOE / NIE** | Ministry of Education & National Institute of Education | **An MOE Branch is treated as one organizational user unit** (e.g., `MOE – ICT Branch`, `MOE – Planning Branch`, `MOE – Finance Branch`). Internal divisions do not act as separate hierarchy levels. |
| **Level 2** | **Province** | Provincial Departments of Education | Controls all educational zones and institutions within the province (e.g. `Southern Province Education Department`). |
| **Level 3** | **Zone** | Zonal Education Offices | Coordinates and reviews workshops for schools and divisions within the zone (e.g. `Galle Zonal Education Office`, `Colombo Zonal Office`). |
| **Level 4** | **Other Institutions** | Divisional Education Offices & Schools | Participating institutions and schools (e.g. `Galle South Divisional Office`). |
